For some reason when submiting the files to jlc, parts J10,J2,J4,J5,J7,J8,J19,J6 keep saying they arent selected even though they are populated in the BOM.

may you please manually search for partnumber:
C3012204 or C5116481 and manualy select either of those two components in their place

Sorry for this inconvinience

Kind regards
Best
